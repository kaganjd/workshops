  </section>
  <section>
      <p><strong>#goals: </strong>participants will leave with a broader understanding of surveillance, and who is subject to it, than they had when they came in. in this workshop, we'll start by collectively developing our own working definition of surveillance. then, we'll look at four historical surveillance technologies‚Äîthe panopticon, the hold, the paper-squeeze, and the mugshot‚Äîand think about how they relate to contemporary cases of surveillance. at the end, we'll revisit the definition we came up with and discuss whether we think it still holds. 
      <p><strong>duration: </strong>1.5 hours</p>
      <p><strong>prerequisites: </strong>familiarity with the snowden revelations is assumed; we don't go into them in depth, and this workshop is meant to expand participants' understanding of privacy and surveillance concerns beyond warrantless wiretapping</p>
      <p><strong>materials needed: </strong>none</p>

    <h2>what even is surveillance?</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>the dictionary definition of surveillance is:</p>
    <blockquote>Close observation, especially of a suspected spy or criminal</blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>take a few minutes to make a drawing of surveillance.
      <ul>
      <li>where does it happen?</li>
      <li>who is surveilling and who's being surveilled?</li>
      <li>how long does it last?</li>
      <li>what kinds of objects are used to surveil?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>what did you come up with? describe to the group some of the elements in your sketches. maybe they include:
    <ul>
      <li>edward snowden</li>
      <li>NSA</li>
      <li>video cameras and laptop cameras</li>
      <li>the police</li>
      <li>advertisers</li>
      <li>the panopticon</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>let's incorporate some of the recurring themes in your sketches into the dictionary definition to flesh it out. that'll be our working defintion, and we'll revisit it at the end of the workshop.</p>

    <h2>the panopticon</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>many conversations about surveillance begin with the panopticon. imagined by jeremy bentham and popularized by michel foucault in <i>discipline and punish</i>, the panopticon is a circular architectural structure with a central watchpost in the center from which a single guard could theoretically see many of the building's occupants at once.</p>
    <p>the watchpost's most important feature: visibility is only one-way; the guard can see out of it, but the building's occupants can't see into the watchpost, so they never actually know for sure whether they're being watched or not.</p>
    <p>it's the classic symbol of social control through the threat of surveillance, and foucault uses it as an analytical tool to talk about how power operates in places like prisons, hospitals, and schools.</p>

    <h2>guillaut√©'s paper-squeeze</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>in 1749, a french inventor named jacques-fran√ßois guillaut√© pitched the idea of a complex system of 12-foot paper-filing wheels for keeping tabs on the city of paris. political scientist and legal scholar bernard harcourt describes the invention and how it fits in with guillat√©'s larger plan for the city:
      <ol>
        <li>"divide the city of Paris into twenty-four equal-sized neighborhoods, then subdivide it into districts of twenty houses"</li>
        <li>"minutely alphanumerize and label each building, entry hall, floor, stairwell, and door"</li>
        <li>"place each district under the supervision of a watchman at a console"</li>
        <li>"give each district watchman instantaneous access to the infinite reams of surveillance information" at the tap of his foot</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>the mugshot</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>the last technology we'll talk about is a photographic one with roots in the history of photography and statistics. the mugshot was conceived by alphonse bertillon, a police officer, as a way of documenting criminality that he believed was visible on the body. along with cesare lombroso, an italian doctor, bertillon developed the tools and methodologies that became the foundation of criminology.</p>
  <p>through comparisons of mugshots, bodily measurements and fingerprints, they attempted to find what scholar dana seitler describes in her article <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/170821"><i>queer physiognomies: or, how many ways can we do the history of sexuality?</i></a> as ‚Äúa noncontradictory sign that would organize and align a series of sexual practices, social behaviors, and medical etiologies within a readable image.‚Äù in other words, they were interested in uncovering essential, biological characteristics of deviancy in order to better predict criminality in others.</p>
  <p>bernard harcourt situates the history of statistics in the same context. he writes in <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo4101022.html"><i>against prediction</i></a>: ‚Äúthe proliferation of numbers helped create the categories of the normal, criminal, and pathological in the nineteenth century.‚Äù</p>
