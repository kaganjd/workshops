      <h1>the internet is made of data packets</h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p><strong>#goals:</strong> get familiar with some of the core parts of internet infrastructure like routers, servers and ISPs; know what a data packet is and how websites get to computers; have enough of an understanding of packet sniffing to be able to explore independently.</p>
      <p><strong>duration:</strong> 1.5 hours</p>
      <p><strong>prerequisites:</strong> none</p>
      <p><strong>materials needed:</strong> internet access; at least one computer; tactical tech's <a href="https://myshadow.org/ckeditor_assets/attachments/146/howtheinternetworks_cardset.pdf">deck</a> of internet infrastructure cards; a packet sniffing application (download <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">wireshark</a> or <a href="https://github.com/samatt/herbivore/releases/tag/v1.1">herbivore</a>).</p>

      <p>activists and organizers use the internet all the time‚Äîto post pictures, to collect information from folks who come to meetings, to plan actions. but many of us don't know how the internet actually works or who holds power to control the flow of data across the network.</p>
      <p>packet sniffing is a small way to take a peek under the hood at the very big system that is the internet.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>break out into groups</li>
        <li>each groups gets a deck of the tactical tech internet infrastructure cards</li>
        <li>spend some time laying out the cards according to how you think a website gets to your computer</li>
        <li>come back together and let's discuss: how did this feel? did you know more or less than you thought?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>website</h3>
        <p>the collection of files‚Äîfrom style files, scripts, images, and plain text‚Äîthat you request from the server and that are ultimately rendered on your computer by your browser.</p>
        <h3>router</h3>
        <p>the device that forwards, or routes, data packets along to where they‚Äôre supposed to go based on the addresses in the packet headers.</p>
        <h3>server</h3>
        <p>the computer that hosts websites and makes them publicly available through a URL. the server responds to client requests.</p>
        <p>any computer can be both a server or client‚Äîit just depends what role the computer is playing. is the computer serving files or requesting files?</p>
        <p>when people use the metaphor of 'the cloud' to talk about file storage, they're talking about a server or just "another person's computer."</p>
        <h3>internet service provider</h3>
        <p>there are many kinds of internet service providers, but in this case we're talking about access providers. these are the companies that install cable in your neighborhood and often supply your router when you set up your internet in your home. ISPs hold a lot of power because they physically control the flow of data.</p>
        <p>for example, whistleblower mark klein <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/">described how the NSA was collecting internet communications</a> by interfering in an ISP's physical infrastructure.</p>
        <p>ISPs are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/29/what-to-expect-now-that-internet-providers-can-collect-and-sell-your-web-browser-history/?utm_term=.e90fcb9af5f6">allowed to sell our browsing data to private companies.</a></p>

      <p>you're looking at the network view. it has two main parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>a diagram</li>
        <li>a table</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>the visualization shows all the devices that access the internet via the router‚Äîthat device at the top. the table has more information about each device.</p>
      <p>the number under each device icon is its <span class="tooltip">private IP address<span class="tooltiptext">private IP addresses are dynamically assigned by the router each time a device connects to it.</span></span>. IP addresses are always structured as four sets of three numbers, separated by periods.</p>
      <p>the private IP addresses in the visualization correspond to numbers in the IP column in the table underneath the visualization. each device has its own row in the table.</p>
      <p>it's easy to find the <span class="tooltip">MAC address<span class="tooltiptext">MAC addresses are "media access control" addresses, unique identifiers assigned by manufacturers of networking devices and etched right onto the device itself. the MAC address follows a strict naming format which is set by the IEEE, so that networked devices can communicate with each other.</span></span> of your device (there's an arrow pointing to it).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>if you double-click your own device in the table, you get to the sniffer view, where you're watching your own packets come and go.</p>

      <h3>exercise: HTTP vs. HTTPS</h3>
      <p>let's use packet sniffing to see the difference between HTTP and HTTPS. the window below shows a common scenario on the web: a website asks you to submit some information into a form.</p>
      <p>first, click the HTTP button below. this will take you to a form that submits data via HTTP. the form data you submit via HTTP will be visible in the packet sniffer.</p>
      <p>then, click the HTTPS button below. this will take you to a form that submits data securely, via HTTPS.</p>
