        <p>"The goal was to identify the mundane locations where a would-be terrorist could blend into society. Plainclothes detectives looked for ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù of radicalization that might give the police an early warning about terrorist plots. The squad, which typically consisted of about a dozen members, focused on 28 ‚Äúancestries of interest."</p>
        <p>Detectives were told to chat up the employees at Muslim-owned businesses and ‚Äúgauge sentiment‚Äù about America and foreign policy. Through maps and photographs, the police noted where Albanian men played chess in the afternoon, where Egyptians watched soccer and where South Asians played cricket.</p>
        <p>After years of collecting information, however, the police acknowledged that it never generated a lead.</p>

      <blockquote><p>This initiative was known as Project SITKA, and with this data from police and social media, the RCMP identified 313 activists across the country who attended protests "opposing natural resource development, particularly pipeline and shale gas expansion." Those who attended anti-capitalist protests, and protests regarding missing and murdered indigenous women, were also targeted.</p>
      <p>The RCMP then picked out 89 individuals who were found to "meet the criteria for criminality," the document states, and created what are described as "protestor profiles" for each of them. These profiles were "made available to front-line officers divisional analysts and law enforcement partners" through the RCMP's automated criminal intelligence database.</p>
